## Install
Adjust Flask Port (Optional for MacBook Users):

For MacBook users, change the default port from 5000 to 5050 in the Flask application file to avoid potential conflicts.

```
port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", 5000))
```
Change it to:
```
port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", 5000))
```
This module works in any reasonable CommonJS environment, such as browsersify, iojs or node.js.





## Configuration
Environment Variables: 

Set the FLASK_APP environment variable to your application's entry point file, for example, app.py.

Unix/MacOS: export FLASK_APP=app.py

Windows Command Prompt: set FLASK_APP=app.py

Windows PowerShell: $env:FLASK_APP = "app.py"

Database and Backend Configuration: 

Review and adjust the backend configuration as needed to connect to your database and ensure proper data handling.




## API
The Online Survey System provides various API endpoints for interacting with the Flask web application. These endpoints enable users to perform actions such as adding places of interest, voting, and retrieving top places and countries. Additionally, two specific endpoints allow for filtering by country and searching for specific place data.

- `GET /`: Displays the main page with top places.
- `POST /add_place_of_interest`: Adds a new place of interest to a specified country.
- `POST /vote_for_place`: Allows a user to submit a vote for a place along with feedback.
- `GET /get_top_places`: Retrieves information about the top-rated places based on votes.
- `GET /get_top_countries`: Retrieves the top-rated countries based on the total votes of their places.
- `GET /get_id`: Generates a new unique user ID for tracking votes and history.
- `GET /history`: Returns the voting history for a specified user ID, showing the places they've voted for.
- `GET /filter_by_country`: Filters and returns all places of interest within a specified country.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `country`: The name of the country to filter places by.
  - **Returns**: A list of places within the specified country along with their vote counts. If no country name is provided or no places are found, an error message is returned.

- `GET /search`: Searches for specific place data within a country.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `country`: The name of the country where the place is located.
    - `place`: The name of the place of interest.
  - **Returns**: Detailed data about the specified place, including votes and user feedback. If the place or country cannot be found, an error message is returned.

These endpoints facilitate the dynamic interaction with the Online Survey System, allowing users to not only participate in surveys but also to explore the data collected on global tourist attractions.
